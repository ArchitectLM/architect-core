# ArchitectLM Project Summary

## Project Overview

ArchitectLM is a flexible, event-driven architecture for building applications that leverage Large Language Models (LLMs). It provides a structured way to define processes, tasks, and systems, with a focus on simplicity, extensibility, and developer experience.

## Core Components

1. **Event Bus**: A reactive event bus for asynchronous communication between components
2. **Process Engine**: Define processes with states and transitions
3. **Task Executor**: Define tasks with implementations that can be executed
4. **System**: Combine processes and tasks into a complete system
5. **Runtime**: Integrate all components and provide execution capabilities

## Implementation Details

### Event Bus

The `ReactiveEventBus` class provides a pub/sub mechanism for event-driven communication. It supports:
- Subscribing to specific event types or all events (wildcard)
- Emitting events to subscribers
- Unsubscribing from events
- Error handling in event handlers
- Handling unsubscribes during event emission

### Process Engine

The `defineProcess` function validates and creates process definitions. It supports:
- States and transitions between states
- Initial state definition
- Transition guards (conditions)
- Wildcard source states
- Array of source states
- Context schemas
- Metadata

### Task Executor

The `defineTask` function validates and creates task definitions. It supports:
- Task implementation functions
- Input and output definitions
- Task context for accessing system services
- Error handling
- Metadata

### System

The `defineSystem` function combines processes and tasks into a complete system. It supports:
- System configuration
- Process and task registration
- System metadata

### Runtime

The `createRuntime` function creates a runtime instance that integrates all components. It supports:
- Process management (create, transition, query)
- Task execution
- Event management
- Testing
- System introspection

## Testing

The project includes comprehensive tests for all core components:
- Event Bus tests
- Process Engine tests
- Task Executor tests
- System tests
- Runtime tests
- Integration tests

## Example

The project includes an example order processing system that demonstrates:
- Defining processes (order process, shipment process)
- Defining tasks (process order, ship order, deliver order)
- Creating a system
- Creating a runtime
- Creating process instances
- Transitioning processes
- Executing tasks
- Subscribing to events

## Next Steps

1. **Documentation**: Add more detailed documentation for each component
2. **Examples**: Create more examples for different use cases
3. **Extensions**: Implement extensions for common patterns (sagas, scheduling, supervision)
4. **Persistence**: Add support for persisting process state
5. **Visualization**: Add tools for visualizing processes and their states
6. **LLM Integration**: Add specific components for integrating with LLMs
7. **Performance Optimization**: Optimize performance for high-throughput scenarios
8. **Monitoring**: Add monitoring and observability features
