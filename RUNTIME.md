# Runtime Implementation

This document describes the runtime implementation for the ArchitectLM framework.

## Overview

The runtime implementation provides a way to execute systems defined using the ArchitectLM DSL. It includes:

- A core runtime that can load system definitions, manage process states, execute tasks, and handle events
- A simple HTTP API for interacting with the runtime
- Mock implementations of task functions (simulating LLM-generated code)

## Components

### Runtime Core

The runtime core (`src/runtime/runtime-core.ts`) is responsible for:

- Loading system definitions
- Managing process states
- Executing tasks
- Handling events

It provides a simple API for interacting with the system:

```typescript
// Create a runtime instance
const runtime = new ReactiveSystemRuntime(systemDefinition);

// Register task implementations
runtime.registerTaskImplementation('task-id', async (input) => {
  // Task implementation
  return { /* output */ };
});

// Execute a task
const result = await runtime.executeTask('task-id', { /* input */ });

// Send an event
runtime.sendEvent('event-type', { /* payload */ });

// Register an event handler
runtime.on('event-type', (payload) => {
  // Event handler
});

// Get process state
const state = runtime.getProcessState('process-id');
```

### HTTP API

The HTTP API (`src/runtime/http-api.ts`) provides a simple REST API for interacting with the runtime:

- `GET /status` - Get the runtime status
- `POST /system` - Load a system definition
- `POST /task` - Execute a task
- `POST /event` - Send an event

### Mock Task Implementations

The mock task implementations (`src/runtime/http-api.ts`) simulate LLM-generated code for tasks. In a real implementation, these would be generated by an LLM based on the task definitions.

## Usage

### Starting the Server

```bash
npx tsx src/runtime/server.ts
```

### Testing the API

```bash
./scripts/test-runtime-api.sh
```

## Implementation Details

### Process State Management

The runtime manages process states using a simple state machine. Each process has a set of states and transitions between them. The runtime keeps track of the current state of each process and transitions between states based on events.

### Task Execution

Tasks are executed by calling the registered implementation function with the provided input. The implementation function returns the output of the task.

### Event Handling

Events are handled by calling the registered event handlers with the provided payload. Events can also trigger state transitions in processes.

## Future Improvements

- Add support for flows (sequences of tasks)
- Add support for parallel execution of tasks
- Add support for error handling and retries
- Add support for persistence (saving and loading system state)
- Add support for distributed execution
- Add support for monitoring and logging
- Add support for versioning and migration
- Add support for security and access control
- Add support for integration with external systems
- Add support for code generation using LLMs
