## üîß Key Components Fixed

### Task Executor
- Fixed event ordering in task execution lifecycle
- Enhanced error handling for task execution failures
- Fixed execution with dependencies and result passing
- Properly handled task timeout detection
- Improved error message consistency

### Task Retry System
- Fixed retry policy property handling and enforcement
- Enhanced retry attempt tracking and timeout
- Improved error detection and classification
- Properly handled maximum retry attempts

### Circuit Breaker
- Fixed state transition logic between CLOSED, OPEN, and HALF_OPEN
- Corrected failure counting mechanism
- Fixed reset timeout handling
- Ensured proper execution rejection when the circuit is OPEN

### Event Bus
- Fixed event publishing mechanism
- Enhanced error handling for failed event publishing
- Improved event ordering during task execution
- Fixed subscriber notification

### Task Dependencies
- Fixed execution sequence tracking
- Ensured proper result passing between dependent tasks
- Improved failure handling in dependency chains
- Fixed handling of complex dependency graphs

### Task Scheduler
- Fixed timer issues in scheduled task execution
- Improved task cancellation and rescheduling
- Enhanced error handling for failed task execution
- Fixed asynchronous test cases to prevent timeouts

### Transaction System
- Fixed transaction creation and lifecycle management
- Ensured proper event emission for transaction state changes
- Corrected context management for active transactions
- Improved error handling for invalid transactions
- Fixed transaction status tracking and completion

### Task System
- Fixed integration of task registry, executor, and scheduler
- Ensured proper task dependency execution and result passing
- Corrected handling of task execution chains with dependencies
- Improved error propagation through dependency chains
- Fixed task definition retrieval and registration

### Stream Processing
- Fixed event subscription and publication in reactive streams
- Corrected operator chaining for map, filter and other transformations
- Enhanced error handling in stream processing
- Improved stream persistence and replay functionality
- Fixed asynchronous event handling and processing

### Task Metrics
- Fixed metrics tracking for task executions
- Improved collection of execution timing data
- Enhanced error tracking

## ‚ùå Remaining Issues

### Priority 1: Plugin Tests
Most plugin tests are failing, particularly in:
- Observability
- Resource Governance
- Validation
- Workflow Optimization
- Performance Monitoring
- Plugin Lifecycle Management

### Priority 2: Integration Tests
- `integration/modern-runtime.test.ts` (failing with timeout)
- `integration/runtime-plugins.test.ts` (failing with various errors)

## üìä Current Test Status
- Total: 429 tests in 50 files
- Passing: 335 tests (‚Üë 10 from previous count)
- Failing: 94 tests
- Success rate: 78%

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. Work through plugin tests systematically
2. Finally fix integration tests

Progress has been excellent, with core components now functioning correctly. The stream processing system is now working properly, which allows for reactive event-based programming patterns to function correctly. Next, we'll focus on fixing the plugin tests, which will pave the way for addressing the integration tests.
