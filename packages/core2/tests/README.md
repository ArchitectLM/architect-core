# Test Consolidation Plan

## Completed Consolidations

### Event Storage
- Created `event-storage-testing-utils.ts` with helpers for creating test events, batch creation, and validation
- Merged `event-storage.test.ts` and `event-storage-impl.test.ts` into a single comprehensive test suite
- Improved tests with better organization, error handling, and null checks
- Added polling patterns for async testing
- Enhanced test isolation
- Removed redundant `event-storage-impl.test.ts`

### Task System
- Extended `task-testing-utils.ts` with specific helpers for dependencies, retries, cancellation, and mocking
- Merged `task-dependencies.test.ts` and `task-retry.test.ts` into `task-executor.test.ts`
- Consolidated `task-scheduler.test.ts` into `task-system.test.ts` as integration tests
- Enhanced test coverage for task lifecycle events, timeouts, dependencies, and scheduling
- Added end-to-end workflow tests for the complete task lifecycle
- Improved test organization with clearer test sections
- Removed redundant test files
